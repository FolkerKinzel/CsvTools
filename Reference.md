# FolkerKinzel.CsvTools
.NET-library to read and write CSV files. 

It is used as a dependency in [FolkerKinzel.Contacts.IO](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FolkerKinzel.Contacts.IO/) - an easy to use .NET-API to manage contact data of organizations and natural persons, including a data model and classes to persist it as vCard (*.vcf) or CSV.

The library contains
* `CsvReader`: Reads CSV from files and streams. It enables you to perform Linq-Queries on CSV files.
* `CsvWriter`: Writes CSV to files and streams.
* `CsvRecordWrapper`: Maps the columns of the CSV file to the columns of your `DataTable` or to the properties of an `object` and performs type conversions. `CsvRecordWrapper` supports aliases with wildcards for CSV column names and ships with a lot of supporting classes - most are data type converters for the most needed data types and an easy to implement interface to create converters of whatever data type you need.
* `CsvAnalyzer`: Analyzes CSV files to get the right parameters for proper reading. This enables you, to read CSV files, that don't fit the standard.
